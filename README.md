I spent week one brushing up on my basics again. I have worked with an Arduino before, but I felt like I lacked some of the foundational understanding of **HOW** it worked and what to do if it didn't.

## 'Hello World' + Blinking LED 
<ins>Tuesday, 09/09/2025<ins>

Based on our experimentation with the Arduino 'Hello World' program on Tuesday, we were tasked with merging the program with the 'LED Blink' code. The objective was for the serial monitor to output 'Hello World' while simultaneously having the LED on the Arduino blink.

I came into this thinking it would be an easy task to complete (considering we had both of the source code files available), but to my surprise, I ran into a couple of issues along the way.

At first. this is how I merged the code:

```C++
int led = 13;
void setup() {
Serial.begin(9600);
pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop(){
Serial.println("Hello, world!");
delay(1000);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   
  delay(1000);                      
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    
  delay(1000);                       
}
```

And this was the error message that popped up on my IDE:

Now looking back at this code, the error is pretty obvious. There were two loop functions, when there should have only been one. When I was merging the code, I figured that since they were separate functions (displaying 'Hello World' and blinking on the LED) that they needed separate loops to run.


I troubleshooted on Chatgpt and got this resposne. I then changed the code and merged the two loop functions.

After digging through Reddit, Geeks for Geeks and ChatGPT, I learnt that when there are 2 loop() functions, the compiler doesn't know which one to run which results in an error being thrown.

**After the code had been updated, the program displayed 'Hello World' and blinked at the same time!**

But in true programming fashion, there was another problem to fix. Every so often, the serial monitor would display the incorrect word. So, instead of saying 'Hello World', it would sometimes just say 'Hell!'.

<img width="260" height="171" alt="Screenshot 2025-09-05 at 9 12 46 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1de0880e-a174-42a2-bff8-bb0ddc5401c5" />

At first I thought that maybe the baud rate in the code wasn't matching the one on the serial monitor. But the two were the set to the same rate. After a quick search, I found that the issue could be that it was printing the word too frequently which was overflowing the serial monitor. I changed the delay to 500, and this seemed to do the trick.

This was my final code:
```C++
/*
  Hello World
*/
int led = 13;
void setup() {
//initialize serial communications at 9600 baud rate
Serial.begin(9600);
pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
}

void loop(){
//send 'Hello, world!' over the serial port
Serial.println("Hello, world!");
//wait 100 milliseconds so we don't drive ourselves crazy
delay(500);
 digitalWrite(led, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(500);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(500);                       // wait for a second
}
```

Seeing the program run (and actaully do it correctly after all that troubleshooting), was awesome. I decided to experiment with an external LED light next. 

## Blinking external LED

I began by first figuring out which leg of the LED was the anode and which was the cathode. I didn't want to shortcirucit my LED on the first try. I learnt that the longer leg was the anode (+ve) and the cathode was the shorter leg (-ve). 

After this, I needed to find the value of the resistors in my kit. I found a great tool online that helped me with this. I plugged in the band colours, and it gave me the ohm value of the resistor. I didn't end up needing to calculate the value myself.

I then created the actual circuit using the Arduino Uno, 2 jumper cables (male to male), the resistor (330 ohm) and a green LED. I followed the circuit diagram provided in Sudhu's repository, and plugged in the source code. I then hit upload and watched the magic happen!

Here's a video of the program running and an image of the circuit:

I then noticed that I had an **HC - SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** in my kit. I decided to try to see if I could create a circuit where the LED would only flash when something came close to the Ultrasonic Sensor. The next section details my exploration with building that circuit. 

## Flashing LED using the HC - SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor 

I used these open source project files as reference:
1. https://www.hackster.io/computeservicestechnology/diy-motion-activated-led-with-arduino-ultrasonic-sensor-cd0fee
2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9oTX20deOJs

I began by first trying to understand what the various pins on the HC - SR04 sensor meant. There were 4 pins - GND, Echo, Trig, VCC. GND was ground, Echo was the output pin, Trig was the input pin and VCC was for power supply. 

I then began connecting the sensor, the LED and the resistor on a breadboard. This was then connected to the Arduino using jumper cables.
1. GND -> Ground
2. VCC -> 5V
3. Trig -> Digital Pin 9
4. Echo -> Digital Pin 10
5. Anode of the LED -> Digital Pin 8
6. Cathode of the LED -> GND

Below is a circuit diagram I made on TinkerCAD to simulate the model before:

Here is the TinkerCAD file:

https://www.tinkercad.com/things/1dZ03uLVOUf-hc-sr04-led?sharecode=3l7n070TypRqj6ZrWTR8lr-tbEiIGrffgCdBVhNSTYA

I then plugged in the code (https://www.hackster.io/computeservicestechnology/diy-motion-activated-led-with-arduino-ultrasonic-sensor-cd0fee), and uploaded the sketch. I was a litte worried that I may casue the LED to short (or even worse, fry the Arduino itself), but the outcome worked just as it was supposed to!

Here is the code:

```C++
// Define pin connections
const int trigPin = 9;
const int echoPin = 10;
const int ledPin = 8;

// Set a distance threshold for detecting movement (in cm)
const int movementThreshold = 20; // Adjust this to your desired distance

void setup() {
  // Initialize pin modes
  pinMode(trigPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(echoPin, INPUT);
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);

  // Start Serial Monitor for debugging
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Starting distance sensor...");
}

void loop() {
  // Trigger the sensor to send out a pulse
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);
  delayMicroseconds(2);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, HIGH);
  delayMicroseconds(10);
  digitalWrite(trigPin, LOW);

  // Measure the duration of the pulse
  long duration = pulseIn(echoPin, HIGH);

  // Calculate distance (in cm)
  int distance = duration * 0.034 / 2;

  // Print distance to Serial Monitor for debugging
  Serial.print("Distance: ");
  Serial.print(distance);
  Serial.println(" cm");

  // Check if an object is within the threshold distance
  if (distance > 0 && distance <= movementThreshold) {
    Serial.println("Object detected within range. Turning LED on.");
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); // Turn on the LED
  } else {
    Serial.println("No object detected or out of range. Turning LED off.");
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW); // Turn off the LED
  }

  // Delay to avoid overwhelming the sensor
  delay(200);
}
```

It was SO cool to see this come to life. I feel like I could keep iterating on this forever (maybe adding a microphone and programming it such that the led only lights up when it picks up on a sound. or even having a row of LED's that light up based on proximity to the Ultrasonic Sensor. The possibilities are endless!)

Reflection: Now that I have learned how to work with an Arduino, connect it to an LED or a sensor and generate specific outputs, I want to mishmash code from different sources to see how it behaves. I also want to practice troubleshooting my code based on the error messages produced by the Arduino IDE, learning the types of errors that can occur and how to pinpoint the exact issue in my code. 

Towards my last exploration, I felt like I was starting to get a hang of what certain parts of the code meant and how it changed the overall output. There were also some great online resources that I used to help figure things out along the way. I still have a way to go, but I'm starting to feel much more confident than I was before with physical computing.
